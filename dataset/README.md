# Composer Dataset
---

This is a collection of data in MusicXML. There is also a CSV containing an
association between MusicXML and the composer.

The MusicXML files were originally from the `MutopiaProject` lilypond repository
and were converted by use of the tool `python-ly`.

The data we have is:
* Horetsky "60 National Airs of Different Nations", 60 pieces
* Bach Chorales Harmonizations, 404 pieces
* Beethoven Piano Sonatas, 23 pieces (split into movements)
